      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p className="lead">
        Octivary is a decision-support tool that helps you compare products using criteria you select. It does not
        provide medical advice and is not a substitute for professional guidance.
      </p>

      <div className="card">
        <h2>Medical disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          Octivary does not provide medical advice. This tool compares publicly available product information to
          support personal decision-making. It is not a substitute for professional medical guidance. Always consult a
          qualified healthcare provider when making medical decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>How scoring works</h2>
        <p>
          Scores are relative and based on the criteria you choose and prioritize. No product is objectively “best,”
          and rankings will change when your priorities change.
        </p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <ul className="clean-list">
          <li>Use Octivary for personal comparison and exploration.</li>
          <li>Do not treat results as clinical guidance or medical advice.</li>
          <li>Do not misuse or misrepresent product data or Octivary’s rankings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Product information and attribution</h2>
        <p>
          Listings use publicly available information and may include manufacturer names, specs, and links to official
          product pages. Octivary is not affiliated with or endorsed by manufacturers unless explicitly stated.
        </p>

        <h2>No warranties</h2>
        <p>
          Octivary is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness, or availability of listings or
          results.
        </p>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>

          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Octivary and its operators are not liable for any damages arising
          from the use of the site or reliance on its comparisons.
